# Route Optimization Tool
This project implements a Route Optimization Tool to find the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The tool visualizes the shortest path from a source to a destination across a weighted graph, where nodes represent City, and edges represent paths between them with associated distances.

## Skills Demonstrated:
Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to solve the single-source shortest path problem for weighted graphs.

## Instructions to Run the Project:
### Clone the repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Ravicv168/Route-Optimization-Tool.git
    Open the route.html file in your browser to start the tool.

### Interact with the route optimization tool:
  - Enter the source and destination city names.
  - Click on button to visualize the shortest path in real-time.
